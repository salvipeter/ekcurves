1. k-curve vs. trigonometric basis (alpha = 0.5)
  - closed curve with 3-4 points, curvature
    => trigonometric will be close to a circle, k-curve is very uneven

2. Changing alpha values globally
  - change from quadratic to cubic while showing control polygons
  - cubic, open curve with a few points & inflections, curvature
  - cubic, closed curve with a few point & inflections, curvature

3. Bezier vs. trigonometric basis (various alpha values)
  - trigonometric, closed curve with a few points & inflections, curvature
  - changing between cubic & trigonometric
    => only small changes when alpha is large

4. Local change of alpha
  - open curve with 5-6 points, curvature
  - select different points, then multiple points
  - [bird] without curvature, wing manipulation

5. Global change of models (various alpha values)
  - [bear, deer] without curvature, with points
  - [rose, elephant] without curvature, without points
